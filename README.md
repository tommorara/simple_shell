# Simple Shell

## Description
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It involves building a simple UNIX command interpreter in C. This shell is a minimalist version, focusing on the basics of how a shell works, manipulating the environment, process creation, and execution.

## Learning Objectives
- Basics of C programming
- Working with system calls
- Understanding of process management in Unix-like systems
- Team collaboration in software development

## Features
- Basic prompt waiting for command input
- Executes commands without arguments
- Handles PATH environment variable
- Implements `exit` and `env` as built-in commands
- Error handling similar to the standard Unix shell (`sh`)

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Compilation: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`
- No memory leaks
- Betty coding style
